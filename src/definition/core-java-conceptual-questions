Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?

A.  Programming Languages are used to write a series of commands and code to the computer to help execute
    various tasks. It is a formal language comprising of a set of instructions that product various kinds
    of output.



What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?

A.  JDK stands for Java Development Kit and it is used to develop Java Applications and applets. It contains
    both the various components like JRE and JVM which includes an interpreter/loader(java), a compiler(javac), an archiver(jar),
    a documentation generator (javadoc).



What is IDE?

A.  IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It helps make programmers life easier by providing an environment where
    their is a source code editor and many other built in functions like debugging and automation tools.
    Some examples of commonly used IDE's for Java are Intellij and Eclipse.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?

A.  As mentioned above a list of Java IDE's are:
    - Intellij
    - Eclipse
    - NetBeans
    - BlueJ


Explain the entire java life cycle.

A.  The Java life cycle runs through a couple of steps. The first step is that it first starts with a source
    program which could be something like Hello.java. Then that source program will be sent into a java comiler (javac).
    After going through the compiler, it will create a java bytecode file which the computer will be able to interpret.
    This .class file will then be sent to the JVM to be interpreted and can be used by any Operating System.



What is class?

A.  A class is like an object constructor or blueprint for creating objects. It is a user defined blueprint
    or prototype from which objects are created.



What is object?

A.  An object is an instance of a class. Objects have state and behaviors.



What is the entry point of an application?

A.  The main method is the entry point of a Java application. When JVM is going to run it will look
    for the main method with its signature and arguments.

    public static void main(String args[]){}



Why main is static?

A.  Main is static so that it can be called by the class. Because it is static, the compiler can call it without
    the creation of an object or before the creation of an object of the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?

A.  The object class is the parent of all other classes in Java.


What is difference between path and classpath variables?

A.  Path is used define where the system can find the executables(.exe) files and classpath is used to specify the location
    . class files. Path is set for use java tool in your java program like java, javac, javap... CLASSPATH is the path for
    Java application where the classes you compiled will be available.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?

A.  Both an abstract class and an Interface contain abstract methods. But a abstract class can also include and use
    non abstract methods. Second, an abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance but and interface does. The source for
    all differences is https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?

A.  No you can't make an object from an Interface and Abstract class. You can use it by creating a reference
    variable of an subclass of an abstract class.


What is Access Specifier?

A.  Access Specifier/modifier regulate access to classes, fields, and methods.
    Example of these are:
    Private: only we can call or use within the class where it is located.
    Public: we can call or use within the class where it is located and from any other class.
    Protected: only accessible from all the class of that particular package.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.

A.  OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. It includes four features: Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation,
    and Polymorphism.
    Abstraction: The process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
    Inheritance: Process where one class can inherit all the properties and features of another class.
    Encapsulation: A way to hide our variables in a class and the only way to access them is with getters and setters.
    Polymorphism: "Many Forms", Includes method overloading and method overriding.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?

A.  A Java Package is used to group together related classes. The package that is imported by default is the
    java.lang package.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.

A.  API stands for application programming interface. It is a document which gives you the list of all packages,
    classes, and interfaces, along with their fields and methods. An API can be described as a way to enable computers
    to possess a common interface, to allow them to communicate with each other.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?

A.  No Java does not support multiple inheritance between classes only for interfaces. It does not support for classes because
    it can cause confusion on what method to call if two parent classes have a similar method name with different procedures.


What is method overloading and when it happens?

A.  Method overloading happens when more than one method has the same name but has a different signature or set of parameters.
    It happens when the number of parameters are different.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.

A.  Exceptions are unwanted events that interrupt the normal flow of a program. The way to handle exceptions is by
    using either the try-catch-finally block or to use throws.



What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?

A.  The static keyword is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a
    class. Static is used when we want to use the class to call a method or variable.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?

A.  When the keyword final is used on a variable or a method it means that it can't be modified. This
    basically means it becomes a constant.


What is final, finally and finalize?

A.  Final is used to make a variable, method, or class unchanged deeming it as a constant.
    Finally is used to place important code that will be executing no matter what in exception handing.
    Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.


What is a constructor ?

A.  A constructor is used to initialize a newly created object. When an object is called, the constructor
    is run.


Can we have multiple constructors in a class?

A.  Yes we can have multiple constructors as long as they have different signatures or number of parameters.



If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?

A.  The default constructor. This constructor has no arguments.

What is "this" keyword in java ?

A.  The "this" keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?

A.  The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects. It is used to call superclass methods,
    and to access the superclass constructor. The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate
    the confusion between superclasses and subclasses that have methods with the same name.
    We can use it in 3 ways:
    1. To refer immediate parent class instance variable.
    2. To call immediate parent class constructor.
    3. To invoke immediate superclass method.


What is JVM stand for ?

A.  JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine


Is JVM platform independent?

A.  Yes it is. It can run on different OS.


What version of java are you using?

A.  We are using JDK 11


What is JAR stand for ?

A. JAR stands for Java ARchive. It is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java
   class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file
   for distribution.


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?

A.  JDK is used to develop and execute java programs and JVM is responsible for executing the java
    program line by line and it is known as the interpreter.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?

A.  JVM is responsible for executing the java program and JRE is used to run the java program for end users.

What is compile time and run time?

A.  Compile-time and Runtime are the two programming terms used in the software development.
    Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code
    while the run time is the time at which the executable code is started running

What is heap?

A.  The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.
    Objects in the heap can be shared between threads.


How java manage it's memory?

A.  In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects,
    called Memory management. Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic
    memory management system called a garbage collector. Thus, we are not required to
    implement memory management logic in our application.


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

A.  String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes.
    StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not. Thatâ€™s why StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer.
    String concatenation operator (+) internally uses StringBuffer or StringBuilder class.
    For String manipulations in a non-multi threaded environment, we should use StringBuilder else use StringBuffer class.

What is Singleton class?

A.  The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation, limiting the number of objects to only one.
    We are allowed to create one instance of a class at a time.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?

A.  Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
    Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual
    Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.


when to use transient variable in java?

A.   transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization,
     if we don't want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient
     keyword. When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original value of the variable
     and save default value of that variable data type


Difference between while and do..while loop?

A.  The difference between while and do..while is that the while loop will execute only if the condition
    is true. The do-while loop will execute the first time no matter what and then check if the condition is
    true.


What is Enum?

A.  Enum is a special class that represents a group of constants.


What is Iterator?

A.  An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections such as an ArrayList or
    a HashSet.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?

A.  The Integer will take more memory because it is an object which takes 16 bytes and an int takes
    4 bytes. Integer is a wrapper class.


Why is String Immutable in Java?

A.  String is immutable for several reasons, here is a summary:

    Security: parameters are typically represented as String in network connections, database connection urls, usernames/passwords etc. If it were mutable, these parameters could be easily changed.
    Synchronization and concurrency: making String immutable automatically makes them thread safe thereby solving the synchronization issues.
    Caching: when compiler optimizes your String objects, it sees that if two objects have same value (a="test", and b="test") and thus you need only one string object (for both a and b, these two will point to the same object).
    Class loading: String is used as arguments for class loading. If mutable, it could result in wrong class being loaded (because mutable objects change their state).


What is constructor chaining in Java?

A.  Calling a constructor from the another constructor of same class is known as Constructor
    chaining. The real purpose of Constructor Chaining is that you can pass parameters through
    a bunch of different constructors, but only have the initialization done in a single place.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?

A.  The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector
    has multiple threads that are used to speed up garbage collection


What is JIT stands for?

A.  JIT stands for Just in Time. The JIT compiler is a component of the runtime enviroment that improves
    the performance of Java applications by compiling bytecode to native machine code at run time.


Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?

A.  Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up
    and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full,
    garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared,
    thus making space for new object


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?

A.  No, Garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory.
    The purpose of garbage collection (GC) is to identify and discard objects that are no longer needed
    by a Java program, so that their resources can be reclaimed and reused.


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?

A.  Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only
    by one thread of execution. Whenever an object is created, it's always stored in the Heap
    space and stack memory contains the reference to it


What is reflection in java and why is it useful?

A.  Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java
    program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the
    program. For example, it's possible for a Java class to obtain the names of all its members
    and display them.


what is multithreading in java?

A.  Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program
    for maximum utilization of CPU


What is the use of synchronization in Java?

A.  Synchronization in Java guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method which requires the same
    lock simultaneously or concurrently.


What is Framework?

A.  A framework is created to be used over and over so that developers can program their application without the manual overhead
    of creating every line of code from scratch. They are prewritten codes used by devs.


What are the testing Framework available in java?

A.  JUnit, JBehave, TestNG, and etc..


Difference between jUnit and testNG?

A.  JUnit is an opensource framework and does not support advances annotations or parallel testing
    TestNG is opensource as well, supports advanced annotations and support parallel testing.



What are the dependencies for this project?

A.  Have to understand databases to finish practice problems



what is dependency injection in java?

A.  Dependency injection (DI) is the concept in which objects get other
    required objects from outside.


What is static binding and dynamic binding?

A.  When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler),
    it is known as static binding. When type of the object is determined at run-time,
    it is known as dynamic binding.
